There are two types of tones in a scale, chord tones are tones that define a chord, and non-chord tones are tones that act as passing tones between chord tones.

Non-chord tones are considered dissonant and when harmonized as block chords recieve a different treatment than chord tones.

There are different ways to recoginze chord tones from non-chord tones.

#### The numerical definition



If numbers are assigned to each tone in the scale starting from 1 with the root, non-chord chord tones would be even numbers in the group.
