The Chord-scale system is a Tonal system that stablishes that for every chord, or harmonic function, there is at least one possible scale that that defines that chord exclusively.

The tones by which the chord is constructed should be contained in the corresponding scale, and the lowest sound is by default the root, unless another sound is explictly indicated in the cyhper.

Chords

Another rule of the Chord-scale system is that every chord-scale pair should represent a certian tonal function in a Tonal system.

A Tonal System is a musical system by which the relationship between chords can be described as one of the three major tonal functions: Tonic, Sub-dominant, and Dominant.

A Chord may be Tonic, Sub-dominant, or Dominant, and the music stream is described as a cycle in which a Sub-dominant leads to a Dominant, a tension is created, and this tension is resolved in the Tonic.
