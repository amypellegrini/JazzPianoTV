The concept of a Bach Minor Scale can be traced to Buenos Aires, where I first heard about it by mouth of different local professors, which according to a common school, there is no Melodic Minor Scale, but only two different and unique scales instead. When used in combination, the ascending Bach Minor Scale, with the descending Minor Aeolian Scale, are traditionally considered as the mixed "Melodic" Minor Scale, which according to this modern standard, it has no theoretical reason to be.

The Bach Minor Scale is simply any Major Scale with the flattened third that turns the scale into minor, which is the easiest way to think about it. The other way is to think in the Aeolian Mode, the minor natural scale assigned by default, and rise the 6th and 7th degree of the scale.

Since the use of this scale can be traced back to Bach times, and considering the importance and influence of Bach work in the development of music history, this scale is named in honor to him.

The following is an example of the use of this scale by Bach.
