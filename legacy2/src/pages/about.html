  <h3>Methodology</h3>

  <p><strong>JazzPianoTV</strong> methodology is based in the following guidelines:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Play what is easy and effortless for you</li>
    <li>Think and express yourself musically at all times</li>
    <li>Improvise in the 12 keys from start</li>
    <li>Enjoy the whole process</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Learn to think and express musically</h4>

  <p>Music is a language, and as such, is not limited only to the mechanical repetition of classic works. A mature and responsible pianist should be proficient not only in reading music accurately, but also in thinking and expressing musically, whether it is by means of interpretation (playing note-by-note scores) or improvisation, in the same way we can sing the lyrcs of a song (interpretation) or talk with other people without having a script for every conversation in everyday life (improvisation).</p>

  <h4>Play what is easy and effortless for you</h4>

  <p>The key to learn fast, enjoying the process, and playing proficiently and accurately from start, is to engage practice with the minimum amount of effort required to play without any mistakes. The approach is always to play what you know you can play well and build progressively from there.

  <p>Advanced pieces require such an effort in concentration that any minor distraction would break your focus and inevitably introduce errors in your performance if you haven't layed out a proper technical background beforehand. This can be very unpleasant and frustrating.</p>

  <p>Instead of playing difficult pieces full of mistakes, I encourage you to gain mastery on small, manageable blocks.

  <p>As you grow your technique and mastery over different skills, your very own enjoyment will lead you and inspire to a higher discipline and extended efforts, required to gain mastery over more advanced techinques.</p>

  <h4>Improvise in the 12 keys from start</h4>

  <p>The practice of patterns in all keys is a sort of edge training that require us to think hard in musical ways. It is also one of the most difficult training practices any musician can get. If you can get around this from the very start, that will pave the way for any other muscial endeauvor.</p>

  <h3>About Amy Pellegrini</h3>

  <p>I'm a Pianist, Web Application Developer, and Entrepeneur. I rather like to think of myself as an Artist and Polymath, although the latter term may result cumbersome and bloated for some people, the same way that the term "entrepeneur" result bloated and cumbersome for me. You can think of me however you like. I created this project as a way to integrate all my creative passion and skills in a single activity that makes me inmensly happy, and enables me to do mature and beautyful things that otherwise would require the effort of several different people, biased by the predjuice of their own specialization.</p>
