# Complementary disciplines

There are other physical disciplines that will help you tremendously in:

- Protect your vertebral column
- Released stored tension in muscles
- Develop your muscles

Disciplines like Yoga, Tai chi, and Swimming are very good counter parts to Piano performance, as they allow you to integrate different aspects of the bridge between you and your body.

In order to be able to reproduce the precises movements that Piano execution requires, we need a mental map, a cognitive map, of what is happening inside of you at every moment of your performance.

# Breath slowly and evenly

Tai chi will give a great insight on breathing, wich is a key factor in performance. Alan Watkins describes this very well in a TEDx talk, I highly recommend you to watch it.

# Tune your muscles



Piano performance requires you te be ready to be seated for hours, moving mainly your arms, but exerting a very precise effort with the whole body.
