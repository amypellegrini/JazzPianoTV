#About JazzPianoTV

## Methodology

JazzPianoTV methodology is based in the following guidelines:

- Learn to think and express musically

- Practice in the 12 keys from start

### Learn to think and express musically

Music is a language, and as such, is not limited only to the mechanical repetition of classic works. A mature and responsible perfomer should not be only proficient in reading music accurately, but should also be able to think and express in musical terms through improvised means, in the same way we can talk without having a script for every conversation in everyday life.
