##About Amy Pellegrini

I'm a Pianist, Web Application Developer, and Entrepeneur. I rather like to think of myself as an Artist and Polymath, although this term result cumbersome and bloated for some people. You can think of me however you like. I created this project as a way to integrate all my creative passion and skills in a single activity that makes me inmensly happy, and enables me to do mature and beautyful things that otherwise would require the effort of several different people biased by the predjuice of their own specialization.
