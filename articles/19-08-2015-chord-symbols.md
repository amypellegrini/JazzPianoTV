This lesson is dedicated to the interpretation and rules of chord symbols.

Chord symbols are musical signs that describe the current harmony with the fewest elements possible.

Usually the lowest sound of the chord is the root fo the chord, and starting from there, chords are built in many different voicings and configurations.

If the chord contains a bass note that is different from the root this is specified in the chord symbol with the note name after a slash.

#### Examples of chord symbols with bass notes

- C/G
- F/A
- Bb7/Ab
