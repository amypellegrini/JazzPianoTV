By JazzPiano I refer to the form of art which consists in expressing oneself musically with the Piano to the extent of spontaneous creation of music, and the hability to perform memorable music by ear.

How the music is interpreted is not as important as the cultural relevance of the motif, theme, or melody is to the public.

A skillful pianist as Brad Mehldau may play Radiohead songs, while Jaques Loussier may develop on Bach works with arrangements, improvisations, and techniques typical of the Jazz skill-set and rich stylistic forms of expression, and both of them are considered to be Jazz musicians.

The point here is that both Bach and Radiohead compositions can be considered part of the cultural legacy of popular music.

Some people may be surprised that I refer to Bach as "popular", but he actually is popular given that many of his compositions are widely known by the general public, and this makes him popular, even when the baroque style in which he performs is not.

We could consider popular songs as small "stories" and JazzPiano as the hability to tell these stories in a casual manner, instead of reading them word by word as one would read the Holy Bible.
