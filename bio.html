      <p>I'm a pianist, artist, software developer, and activist for transgender people rights.</p>

      <p>I've played the piano for over 15 years and I have 4+ years of professional experience in software and web applications development.</p>

      <p>My talent is not limited only to this fields, I also dedicate (althuogh not in a professional manner) to writing, drawing, and the creation of audiovisual educational/documental material.</p>

      <p>Given this plurality of interests in different disciplines, which I make an effort to integrate and empower one with each other, is that I consider myself a polymath woman.</p>

      <p>When I was 28 years old I discovered and embraced my transgender condition, came out of the closet, and ever since I've worked intensely to get insight on the general situation of transgender people, with the firm intention to evoke a trend of thought which allows a well inclusion of the trans community, and also brings greater freedom for every human being in its condition of being.</p>

      <p>To <em>denuonce, demistify, deconstruct, and propose</em> are the 4 axis of my work as an artist and activist, 4 axis which I consider essential to engage a cultural reform, which in time echoes itself in the form of social transformation.</p>
