Chopin's advice on alterations and complex key signatures was that you should give no preference to keys with few or no alterations, and learn to read keys with many alterations first so nothing will surprise you.

If we didn't know anything about notes without alterations, we would learn only altered notes as a single bit of information, and there is no reason for this to be harder than learning notes without alterations, after all there are all only notes.
