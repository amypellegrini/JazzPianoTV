#### The Main Goal

JazzPiano, and Music in general, is a field so vast in possibilities that, most of the time, the task of deciding what, when, and how to play, overwhelms the capacity of a great percentaje of music students.

Knowing how to approach practice in order to play an instrument proficently may be a daunting experience for many people.

To achieve the most comprehensive Piano technique one should understand that the landscape to be explored is so immense, so vast, that it is absolutely impossible for one single person to ever master it entirely.

#### Be patient

To achieve mastery with an instrument requires time and practice. The length of your musical achievements will depend mostly in the amount of time you spend playing, provided that you understand the technique.

#### Know what you are doing

If you don't know that you are doing, then comfort yourself at least with the idea that you are experimenting with the instrument, and know that what you are doing is an experiment.

Out of experiments is achieved knowledge, and out of knowledge a proper technique can be developed.

#### Be loving

"Loving" may be a pretty vague attribute to describe, but it is one of the most --if not the most-- important attribute for practice.

To be loving means that you don't hit your piano, you don't practice out of anger or rush, you don't force yourself to unnatural situations that may hurt your body, you aviod any harm to your instrument and your body.

You treat your musical "space" (your practice, your instrument, and your own body) as you would treat a beloved one.

#### Enjoy your path

Whenever a person wants to force himself or herself to be a pianist, it is most probable that such person must be doing it for a different reason other than playing. This reveals an inner conflict of interests and is not a good influence for learning.

Learning is a joyful process, and when you enjoy what you learn you learn faster, because proper learning requires focused attention, and if you are forcing yourself to do something you don't want to do (like a forced schedule or daily time of practice), your attention will roam, your performance will be poor, and you will create harmful and unnecessary associations between sacrifice, suffereing, pain, and music.

#### Fill in the hours

A very simple approach is to simply play, no matter what, whatsoever crossess through your mind, keeping the goal of filling in a certain given amount of time.

It all boils down to "play, and do your best" approach which is the closest step to live performance, it is a step that you will have to go through.

If it is the only step you know, then keep with it! Very soon the next step will be revealed!
