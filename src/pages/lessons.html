  <h3>Private lessons</h3>

  <p>If you'd like to go forward and take personalized lessons feel free to call me or send an email with a valid phone number and I'll be getting in touch with you soon.</p>

  <p>To ensure the quality of the lessons I take no more than three students a day, so vacancies are limited, please get in touch soon to ensure your vacancy.</p>

  <h3>Location</h3>

  <p>Personal lessons are given at my home in Southeast London. Each session typically takes between 1 to 1 and half hours on average, and there are no pre-requisites required other than an honest desire to learn.</p>

  <h3>Workshops & Lectures</h3>

  <p>If you are an organizer and would like to deliver a workshop or public lecture targeted to multiple students (and the general public as well), I encourage you to get in contact, I'm always open to proposals.</p>
