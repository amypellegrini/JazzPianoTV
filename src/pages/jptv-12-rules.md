## JazzPianoTV 12 Rules for Piano Mastery

1. Play only that which you can play perfectly well.
2. Play only that which you can repeat many times in exactly the same manner.
3. Play only that which you can play easily and effortlessly, without too much preparation.
4. Play only that which you can play by memory.
5. Never sacrifice perfection for speed, play as fast as you can without committing any mistakes.
6. Play with the right hand only that which you can also play with the left hand and vice versa.
7. Play only that which you enjoy, never force yourself to play.
8. Learn to think, read, write, and improvise music, just as you once  learned to think, read, write text, and improvise spoken sentences in ordinary conversation. Get used to play whatever you can clearly hear in your mind. Music is a language: learn to speak that language with your hands.
9. Get used to play in varied social circumstances: when you are alone, in the stage, in front of an audience, and with other musicians. Donâ€™t forget Music is primarily a social activity.
10. Get used to play with obstacles and difficult circumstances.
11. Respect your audience. Be on time for the show, express your gratefulness to them for taking the time to listen to you. Talk with them about your music, explain your decisions to them, remember you could not do what you do without them; they are your stakeholders.
12. Feel free to break any (or all) of these rules anytime you want, without guilt, sadness, or regret.
