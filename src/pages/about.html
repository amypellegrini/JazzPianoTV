<h4>Learn to think and express musically</h4>

<p>Music is a language, and as such, is not limited only to the mechanical repetition of classic works.

<h3>About Amy Pellegrini</h3>

<p>I'm a Pianist, Web Application Developer, and Entrepeneur. I rather like to think of myself as an Artist and Polymath, although the latter term may result cumbersome and bloated for some people, the same way that the term "entrepeneur" result bloated and cumbersome for me. You can think of me however you like. I created this project as a way to integrate all my creative passion and skills in a single activity that makes me inmensly happy, and enables me to do mature and beautyful things that otherwise would require the effort of several different people, biased by the predjuice of their own specialization.</p>
