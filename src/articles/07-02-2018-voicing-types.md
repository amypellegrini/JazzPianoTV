## Voicing types

On this occasion we will learn about different voicing types we can use for our chords.

I will list them here and then we will explore them one by one:

- Closed
- Open
- Mixed
- A Form
- B Form
- A Form Drop-2
- B Form Drop-2

Each voicing can be best suited for different purposes or motivations for several different reasons.

### Closed

The most simple and common form in wich a chord may be presented. The leading tones are as close together as possible.

### Open

By *open chord* we mean that the leading tones are separated by gaps, or jumps between them.

### Mixed

Usually the fifth is relegated to the left hand.

### A Form

A and B Forms are a set of voicings described by John Mehegan in his educational book series on Jazz Piano.

These chords are inspired by chords featured in Chopin and Ravel compositions, and include 7th, 9th, and 13th chords.

The A Form is usually associated to Chopin.

### B Form

The B Form is most commonly associated to Ravel.

### A Form Drop-2

Drop-2 is technique by which the second leading tone in the chord (from bottom up) is "dropped" to the top of the chord.

Drop-2 voicings are usually used for comping.

### B Form Drop-2

B Form Drop-2 is Drop-2 applied to the B Form in the same manner as described for the A Form Drop-2.
