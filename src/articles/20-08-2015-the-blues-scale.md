## The Blues Scale

The Blues Scale is one of the --if not *the*-- most important scales in Jazz for the simpliest reason that the Blues Style, which is one the foundations of the Jazz language, is largely defined by the sound of the Blues Scale.

## Harmonic structure of the Blues Scale

The Blues Scale can be defined as a Minor Pentatonic Scale, with a passing tone added between the exactly in the middle of the scale.

One of the main features of the Blues Scale is that, given its intrinsic melodic traction, it may be used over passing chords under a common harmonic context.

Since the Blues scale is mostly used as a Tonic Scale, a leading-tone to the root can be added to emphasize the Tonic quality of the scale.
