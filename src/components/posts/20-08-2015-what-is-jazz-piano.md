By Jazz Piano we mean the hability to express one self freely with the piano to the extent of spontaneous creation of music, and the hability to perform any song belonging to the Western musical tradition.

By Western musical tradition we mean any song that can be easily recongnized by the public, and by this I mean any average person raised in an ordinary western cultural environment.

How the music is interpreted is not as much important as the cultural relevance of the motif, theme, or melody is to the public.

A skillful pianist as Brad Mehldau may play Radiohead songs, Jaques Loussier may develop on Bach works with arrangements, improvisations, and techniques typical of the Jazz skill-set and rich stylistic forms of expression.
