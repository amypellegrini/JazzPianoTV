There are many different ways by which musical scales may be practiced.

The first step is to be able to play the scale in a relaxed manner, at a slow pace, in a uniform subdivision of notes.

Not too much obsession with perfection should be stressed here.

Example: C Major Scale in eighths

#### C Major Scale

#### Eb Major Scale in eighths

Then you can work in porgressive dificulty by adding variations to the scale as it follows: apply rhythmic patterns to the scale, and if possible, apply any given rhythmic pattern in all possible combinations including anticipation, ritardation, permutation, sequential variation, etc.

A complete exploration of the scales imply the achievement of a deep understanding of all the necessary information you need to be ready to play instantly without errors. This information is aquired in the form of muscular memory, and improve your hability for musical deduction (when you already know how to play something without ever having played it before).
