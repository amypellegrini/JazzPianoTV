The II-V-I sequence can be considered as the building block of harmony for many important reasons: it is the most elegant representation of the subdominant (movement), dominant (tension), tonic (ease/repose).

This can be represented by the following circle graph:

The relationship between these three elements acts like a force that sets the movement-tension-repose dynamic of Tonalism in motion.
